      '"As technical lead in Greenfinch technology, I worked alongside Kamal for almost two years and feel confident in recommending him to hyour organisation.
      Kamal was instrumental in delivering a new notifications framework for the Etech project to a high technical standard while under considerable time pressure. At this time he
      demostrated leadership as well as technical skills by directing a small team to complete his design. The customer was delighted to have this functionality delivered on budget and to
      a high degree of quality. In customer-facing rolers, Kamal has distinguished himself with several clients. He has a calm and professional demeanour with an ability to elicit
      requirements from non-technical customers. He has gained the respect of both peers and management for an ability to articulate both challenges and associated solutions to ensure long-term
      project success. Design and planning come naturally to Kamal. As he matured into his role at Greenfinch he succeeded in adapting to increasingly greater responsibilities in these realms,
      ultimately being granted full care of the company's largest and most complex project. In his tenure at Greenfinch, Kamal has been a key figure in the success of the Etech project and
      in ensuring that the team as a whole remain focused and happy."'
