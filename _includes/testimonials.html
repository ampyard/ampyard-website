          <p>Vivek is one of the best coaches I have had the privilege of being associated with. He brings along a wealth of knowledge on Agile, DevOps and diverse technologies as well as technical coaching competence. He is an exemplary version of
            an
            Agile Coach and does not shy away from challenging the status quo.</p>
          <p>With extensive experience coaching on best technical practices, ways of working both at team level & at scale. He is very adept at Cloud / DevOps practices, tools and
            technologies and keeps himself abreast of latest in the industry. He is a constant learner and has the uncanny ability to think radically and is open to experimenting new domains/frameworks. His coaching skills, creative thinking,
            transparency and openness makes him an absolute pleasure to work with. </p>
          <p>His strengths in being able to challenge, pro-actively offering solutions, ideas and exceptional communication make him an asset to any organization. His contributions
